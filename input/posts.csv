Mad weird since we're usually all jokes. Can't believe he won't be just next door anymore. Gonna miss him like crazy",75.jpg,eliz_kim,-20:50,

When we pulled them out, everyone LOST IT 🤣 We took sooo many pics with the '81' balloons, and David thought it was hilarious. It was such a fun day.

After the votes came in, I found out none of my friends voted for me cuz they thought I was too busy with other stuff to commit, really?? I was super ready to balance it all. Feelin' pretty let down. They didn’t even ask me about my plans",202.jpg,this_jack,-16:01:00,

Later, I met a junior who's been vegan for 6  months (WOWWW!!). She shared awesome tips and suggestions on the best vegan spots around campus. We hung out after classes and even talked about our summer plans. So happy to have a new vegan friends♥️♥️  She also invited me for a vegan bbq. I think to bring vegan sausages.

Like, is this not fate?! I already had this gift idea planned, so it was meant to be 🫶 I didn’t wanna do basic merch tho, so I put together a box with all her fave things. Each item’s matched with a Taylor lyric! 🥰 Like, I got her a perfume and obvi added “leave the perfume on the shelf.” Super excited to give it to her!!🤩🤩",deb.jpg,DebbyRyaz,-17:40:00,
140,"YESTERDAY WASSSSS GREAT!!!!! We were joking around about who’s the fastest, so me and two friends ended up racing at the park. I didn’t even have proper running shoes but we went for it anyway. We all sprinted as hard as we could… and somehow we finished at the EXACT same time! No one won. We were totally out of breath. So random but sooo fun!",213.jpg,BeardedMatt,-19:42:00,

203,"hi guys, don't ever trust your GPS too much!!! last week i took a wrong turn and ended up lost on the highway miles away from where i needed to be. i was coming back from a meeting. the GPS was no help at all, just kept rerouting over and over. i felt super anxious as more than an hour passed 😓 finally I found the right way, but not without wasting a lot of time and gas. even with all my tech, getting lost is way too easy. hope i don't get lost again! #NavigationNightmares",CuriousChad.jpg,CuriousChad,-16:01:00,
54,"HAVE YOU SEEN MY KITTY???? 😢 One month ago, I came home late, and my lovely cat Stella wasn't there to greet me. I thought she might be hiding and I was very sleepy, so I didn’t search for her and just went to bed. But, when I woke up next morning, she was still nowhere to be found. I asked my neighbors, searched the neighborhood in a panic. SHE WAS NOWHERE... It's been a month now. The emptiness without her is unbearable. 😔 Looking back, I feel terrible that I didn’t start searching for her earlier. Missed you, my dear kitty 🥺🥺#WhereIsMyCat?",genericphoto3.png,Ada_Lopez,-18:15:00,
