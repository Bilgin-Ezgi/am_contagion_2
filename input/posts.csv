165,"I was having lunch with my friends (and was super excited for the Margherita pizza). Then I checked my email. Boom! Rejection from The Boston Conservatory at Berklee... 😢😢 the summer theater school I'd been counting on. I just couldn't believe it. My stomach flipped. I didn’t even wanna eat my pizza anymore. My friends tried to cheer me up though but... Anyway. We ended up leaving early. I spent the rest of the day thinking about the chance I felt like I lost. Sometimes dreams don’t work out. It was one of those days😔",165.jpg,Smitty12,-12:10:00,
1,"always so jealous of my art class friends cause i thought they had it easy, just drawing and chillin. so i decided to try it out one day 🙃 we did self-portraits and omg mine turned into some Picasso-level abstract mess. one eye was HUGE, the other was tiny, nose was like ?? and the mouth? just vibing somewhere random. meanwhile, everyone else’s portraits actually looked like them. perfect shading, eyes in the right place, all that good stuff 🙄 the art teacher looked at mine for a sec and was like, wow… that’s… unique, but we all knew she was just trying to be nice lol. art class isn’t as chill as it looks, y’all!

112,"During my first year of college, I learned a tough lesson about teamwork 😔 There were four of us in our project group, but soon it became clear I was the only one taking it seriously. I ended up doing all the work while the others barely lifted a finger. On presentation day, my teammates were late. Leaving me to present sections I hadn't even prepared. Those were their responsibility. PLUS, the professor graded us as a group, not individually. We received a truly unfair grade that didn’t reflect my effort at all. That experience turned me off group projects for a while. And no, we’re not friends anymore",pizza.jpg,john73,-6:53:00,
205,"Spent all of Saturday with my friend Sophia turning our old jeans into a tote bag after getting inspo from a TikToker! 😎😎 Eva’s super good at this stuff, even though she was stressing when the sewing machine jammed 😅😅😅😅 We had to redo a bunch of things, but we didn’t give up! Added some cool pockets and patches. then... BAMMM it turned out way better than we thought though. Totally worth it!!!!!🥰",coachmatthews.jpg,coachmatthews,-20:50:00,
220,"🤩🥰 This Saturday was all about me and my friend hangin' with Milo, my new dog 🐶 He brought his dog, Skye, too and the doggos got along so well. We spent the whole day outside playin' with them. They were runnin' around like crazy and lovin' the PB cookies we gave them. By the end of the day, we were tired, but Milo and Skye were still full of energy 😂😂😂",220.jpg,B.Mike,-17:50:00,
41,"messed up the physics prelim this semester. I mean MESSED UP MESSED UP MESSED UP. Got the lowest score. Ridiculous. It wasn't even hard. I don't understand what happened. Do you know the worst part???? The professor announced everyone’s name and grade in front of the whole class. When she got to mine, I felt my heart drop. I was sitting all the way in the back, trying to sink into my chair and just disappear. My face was burning. I wanted to walk out so bad. But I was too stunned to even move. I’ve never been this embarrassed in the class",41.jpg,_aikira_,-15:11:00,
50,"imagine sitting alone at lunch during the first day of college. that's what happened to me last year. it was humiliating and i felt like everyone was staring at me. ate my sandwich super fast and tried to rush back to class but ended up getting lost. and then finally, made it. but totally exhausted. hoping to make some friends soon",50.jpg,this_jack,-18:01:00,
75,"Yesterday hit different. One of my close friends had to move 'cause he's transferring universities. We grabbed one last lunch with our group to say our goodbyes. The ride back was dead silent. Mad weird since we're usually all jokes. Can't believe he won't be just next door anymore. Gonna miss him like crazy",75.jpg,eliz_kim,-20:50,
213,"Had the best time at my friend David’s 18th bday party! 🎉 I still had the balloons from my uncle’s 81st birthday (shaped like a 8 and 1 😂), so I brought them for a joke. When we pulled them out, everyone LOST IT 🤣 We took sooo many pics with the '81' balloons, and David thought it was hilarious. It was such a fun day. I seriously couldn’t stop smiling!",213.jpg,BeardedMatt,-18:00,
201,"😢😢😢😢 Feeling a bit shaken today. I heard something that really threw me off. A friend suggested that my best friend might have sabotaged my junior year project by misplacing my research notes. It’s hard to believe. I've always trusted him and can't imagine he would do something like that. I’m not sure how to approach this or even if I should bring it up. Have any of you dealt with something similar? How did you handle a situation where what you heard didn't match up with what you believed about a friend? Could use some advice",201.jpg,TimBJenkins,-9:16:00,
202,"I was sooo hyped to run for the debate team, thinking my friends had my back. Turns out... nope 😤After the votes came in, I found out none of my friends voted for me cuz they thought I was too busy with other stuff to commit 😡 Like, really?? 😡 I was super ready to balance it all. Feelin' pretty let down. They didn’t even ask me about my plans 😕😕😕 ",202.jpg,this_jack,-16:01:00,
280,"Guys, the first day of swimming class with my friends was legit. none of us could swim for real, but we still jumped into the freezing water! 😂 😂 tried to swim laps but ended up having a splash fight and laughing the whole time. we were way behind everyone else. who cares? we had the best time", 2100.jpg, BeardedMatt,-15:55,
208,"🥳 As a vegan, first day on on campus went so smoothly🥳 Enjoyed a delicious vegan bagel for breakfast and a tasty tofu bowl for lunch. Later, I met a junior who's been vegan for 6  months (WOWWW!!). She shared awesome tips and suggestions on the best vegan spots around campus. We hung out after classes and even talked about our summer plans. So happy to have a new vegan friends♥️♥️  She also invited me for the next lunch organized by  Animal Rights Club. I think to bring vegan sausages. What else can I bring, any suggestions?",coachmatthews.jpg,coachmatthews,-20:00,
11,"I just made the cutest Taylor Swift-themed gift box for my bestie's bday 💖💖 So my bestie and I are true Swiftie AF, and guess what? We somehow scored last-minute tix to her Philly concert! Like, is this not fate?! I already had this gift idea planned, so it was meant to be 🫶 I didn’t wanna do basic merch tho, so I put together a box with all her fave things. Each item’s matched with a Taylor lyric! 🥰 Like, I got her a perfume and obvi added “leave the perfume on the shelf.” Super excited to give it to her!!🤩🤩",deb.jpg,DebbyRyaz,-17:40:00,
140,"YESTERDAY WASSSSS GREAT!!!!! We were teasing each other in class about who’s the fastest. So me and two friends decided to race at the school’s football field after class. I didn’t even have proper running shoes, but we went for it anyway. We all ran as fast as we could… and somehow we finished at the EXACT same time! No one won!  We were out of breath. Haha. Definitely one of the most random but fun things we’ve done!",213.jpg,BeardedMatt,-19:42:00,
51,"Last week's get-together with friends was amazing! We binge-watched our favorite movies until 2 AM, rocked a karaoke battle, and just chatted and laughed until the early morning. We also experimented with all kinds of face masks and tried out tons of nail polish colors at home. Even though we ended up sleeping through class the next day, it was totally worth it!",deb.jpg,DebbyRyaz,-15:52:00,
